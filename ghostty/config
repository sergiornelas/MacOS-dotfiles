# TODO
# 1. Ghostty is not possible to launch CLI with flags for creating scripts:
#    >> ghostty --font-family="JetBrains Mono"
#    https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/2872
# 2. The command new_tab_with_cwd or --cwd=current argument still doesn't exist
# 3. Not able to use native tabs, it breakes the yabai layout. You are forced to use tmux
#    or navigate with the auto-session plugin
# 4. Kitty terminal has insert file/path/line commands. Also vim mode (kitty-grab). Ghostty doesn't.
# 5. Kitty has cursor trail animation, which is cool. Ghostty doesn't.
